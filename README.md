## This react project is a Calculator. What made it more interesting is that it can give prank result sometimes.

### This calculator not only do some calculation but also gives the prank value. So, its aiming to do prank with your friends and family.

My approach was simple making this project.

1. First I made all the HTML and CSS needed for the project.

2. Secondly I made the reusable button component and loop with it.

3. After that different functionalities are added such as making the display work, AC and C button work, Operators and dot button.

4. The keypress button on calculator was made functional.

5. After that the prank is added by random value.
